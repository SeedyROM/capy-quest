# Capy Quest (Placeholder Name)

## Revision 0 (Initial Idea)

Capy Quest is a 2D platformer where you traverse the earth; befriended the townsfolk and
wildlife, searching for fruits and finding the most cozy hot springs filled with satsumas!

### Level Design:

- Collect items and befriend everyone so you can reach the satsuma filled hot springs at the end!
- Specific animals/people that let you do specific things!
  - Birds can make you fly around
  - Crocs can be ridden and bite through foliage in your way
  - Cats can help you catch fish to sell at the market for gold
    - Not all cats, there's a secret society that's not a fan of you...
  - Humans and special creatures get you from level to level.
  - _etc ..._
- You can gain animals/peoples trust by giving them things they want.
- Once you befriend a specific animal or a person you get a stamp in your passport showing that you're a cool ass dude and can be trusted.

### Worlds

There will be 3 locations with 6 levels each.

#### Progression?

1. You start in the south american jungle, but it's a pretty chill spot. Everyone knows your name. You're friend with everyone!
2. You catch a ride to florida on a huge bird who you win his trust by giving him 20 fish.
   - You gotta build your reputation and befriend all the new folks and get your passport filled out.
3. You get on a shipping vessel to Japan
   - You're finally able to find your saught after hot springs but they're guarded by tanuki guards with bamboo swords and ninja skills.
   - You quickly realize that the the tanuki are just soldiers for the nyan mafia. A syndicate of rough and tumble RIPPED cats that run the onsens (hot springs) in all of Japan, they don't accept you and want you gone.

**Finally you must defeat the nyan mafia and become the onsen king!**

You make the onsen open to everyone and invite all your friends along the way to come hang out!

### Final Scene

Everyone you befriended is hanging out in the onsen with you chilling hard, you get to talk to everyone and see what's up.

There's a cutscene where somebody places a satuma on your head and it fades to black...
